            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And knowing that his diſciples (howſoever they were well aſſured, that he was that <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> promiſed to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and foreordained by the almighty to ſaue mankinde) were notwithſtanding ignorant of the meanes of mans rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation, and ſo were ignorantly by a common error of their time deceived, looking for an earthly kingdom in him
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1744:4"/> whoſe<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 45.6.</note> ſcepter is a ſcepter of righteouſneſſe, he taught them in a few words, what eſtate &amp; condition, both of his <hi>kingdome</hi> and <hi>prieſthood,</hi> ſhould be looked for, even that al our ſalvation muſt wholy depend vpon the merit of his <hi>death,</hi> and vertue of his <hi>reſurrection:</hi> and ſo much he ſignified vnto them, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, the 22. verſ. of this chapter, ſaying, <hi>The ſonne of man muſt ſuffer many things, and be reproved of the elders, and of the High Prieſts, and Scribes, and be ſlaine, and the thirde day riſe againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus inſtructed them, he delivereth a new doctrine, in theſe words of my text, whereby all are taught, what muſt be done by them, who are willing to be partakers of that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which he for his followers hath deſerved. Which place is ſo much the more worthy our memory and due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe ſmall fruit may redound vnto vs, from all, that is delivered concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; the whole <hi>worke</hi> of our <hi>rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> except we throughly vnderſtand the meanes, by which we may be made his <hi>diſciples.</hi> For to them onely belong al the promiſes of his <hi>kingdome,</hi> and the inheritance thereof. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour therefore being vnwilling that any thing ſhould be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from vs, which might direct vs in the pathway to our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath <hi>ſaid vnto all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe dayly, and follow me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occaſion of theſe words, although omitted by this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt,</hi> is notwithſtanding expreſſed by <hi>S. Matthew</hi> in the 22. <hi>ver.</hi> of his 16. chapt. &amp; by <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p>And becauſe he knew, that this was a common fault to all his diſciples, &amp; therefore much more common to the people, who were all earneſtly bent to the heaping vp of worldly wealth, vnwilling to endure tribulations and afflictions, hee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1744:4"/> thought it now high time to inſtruct them vnto patience, and therefore called the people with his diſciples vnto himſelfe; &amp; <hi>ſaid vnto all, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe dayly, and follow me.</hi>

            <p>When not long ſince I began the vnfolding of this peece of Scripture which I haue now read vnto you, containing a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect doctrine, or an exact rule, ſufficient for the teaching, or guiding of all that will follow Chriſt, then in part I declared the meanes, by which we might be ſo qualified, that the curſe of this flying booke, might no way take hold of vs, or any our houſes. Then in this Scripture I conſidered,</p>
            <p>Firſt the vniverſalitie, in theſe words, <hi>And he ſaid vnto all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the neceſſitie implyed in the condition, in the words following, <hi>if any man will come after me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the doctrine it ſelfe, divided into 3 praecepts, in the laſt words, <hi>let him deny himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe dayly, &amp; follow me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You heard then, that this doctrine was vniverſall, for that Chriſt delivered it vnto <hi>all,</hi> yet to <hi>all</hi> not ſimply, but to <hi>all</hi> with a reſtraint, to <hi>al</hi> the elect, not to any one of the reprobate. And then likewiſe you heard that this doctrine was neceſſarie: for that every one that would not harken to the ſame, was to look for no better, then to be caſt into olde, deepe, and large<note n="f" place="margin">Eſai 30.33.</note> 
               <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> whoſe burning is <hi>fire and much wood,</hi> kindled with the <hi>breath of the Lord,</hi> as with a <hi>river of brimſtone.</hi> And then laſt of all, I ſpake of the third praecept, wherein you heard that the whole nature of man was reiected and diſallowed, together with all the powers and deſires thereof, as farre vnfit to bee in any of Chriſts Diſciples; &amp; therefore that a neceſſitie was laid vpon vs to renounce all fleſhly delights, to humble our ſelues vnder the Almightie hand of God, &amp; to conſecrate our ſelues wholly to him, through the obedience of faith, and that for the better performance hereof, wee ought, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to pray for Gods aſſiſtance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to vſe a dayly and a ſerious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our profeſſions and vocations. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> to conferre the eſtate of the things of this world, with things celeſtiall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> to be carefull of our living and converſing even from our childhood, till both our feete bee put into the graue.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1744:13"/> the 2. precept with the 3. vnſpoken of according to which if wee will frame our liues, wee ſhall find that they are moſt forcible meanes to make the curſe of the<note n="g" place="margin">Zach. 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>flying booke</hi> of no force againſt vs.</p>
            <p>The 2. precept therefore is, that <hi>wee muſt take vp our croſſes dayly;</hi> wherein let mee deſire you, to conſider with mee, <hi>Firſt,</hi> what <hi>croſſes</hi> are, for every man muſt take vp a croſſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> what <hi>croſſe</hi> it is that every one muſt take vp, it is his <hi>own croſſe; let him take vp his croſſe.

The conſideration of the abſurdity hereof, maketh him in the ſame place to conclude: <hi>Non ergo ex paſſione certa eſt iuſtitia, ſed ex iuſtitia paſſio glorioſa eſt,</hi> A man is not therefore righteous becauſe he ſuffereth, but his ſuffering is therefore glorious, becauſe it is for righteouſnes. And therefore the Lord hath not ſaid in generall, <hi>bleſſed are

            <p>The <hi>enimy came,</hi> and <hi>ſowed tares among the wheat,</hi> but it was <hi>while men ſlept,</hi> Mat. 13.25. The <hi>fooliſh virgins,</hi> were not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

You your ſelues haue been travailers a long time in a <hi>ſtrange country,</hi> farre from your <hi>home,</hi> much farther then either of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and manie of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1744:37"/> you haue laden your ſelues (I doubt it not) with great riches, with the precious riches, of <hi>knowledge,</hi> of <hi>honeſty,</hi> and of <hi>Godlie living,</hi> and you ſeeme to be cloathed with ſincerity, integrity, and purity, of <hi>faith, loue,</hi> and other affections, as if all were <hi>pure white</hi> about you; and are even ready to enter the haven of the celeſtiall <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> now if any of you thus furniſhed with the abundance of Gods bleſſings, ſhall thereby exalt, and <hi>lift vp himſelfe,</hi> and thinke in his heart, with the prowd <hi>Phariſee,</hi> that he is not,<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 18.11.</note> 
               <hi>as other men are,</hi> I may boldly ſay, that, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath made ſhipwracke of all, and is now as much to be pitied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as erſt himſelfe would haue pitied that marchant.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould be ſet vpon a <hi>pinnacle,</hi> or vpon the <hi>ridge of an houſe,</hi> and then would not looke to your <hi>footing,</hi> could you be thought leſſe then deſperate? Such is your eſtate: it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God many waies to bleſſe you all; all of you muſt needes confeſſe as much. Such his bleſſings are vnto you, as ſo manie ridges of houſes, or tops of pinnacles, whereon he hath ſet you to walke, though ſpiritually: but your immodeſt, and prowd vſage of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, argueth your careleſſe looking to your footings. For could you but enter the examination of your owne harts, it would eaſily be graunted me, that the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> taketh a pride in his <hi>authority,</hi> the <hi>Gentleman</hi> in his <hi>parentage,</hi> the <hi>Rich man</hi> in his <hi>wealth,</hi> the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> in his <hi>ſtrength,</hi> the <hi>learned</hi> in his <hi>knowledge,</hi> the <hi>preacher</hi> in his <hi>preaching,</hi> yea and every man in every good thing he hath, or doth.</p>
            <p>So ready are wee ſacrilegiouſly to attribute to our ſelues the praiſe of Gods bleſſings due to him alone, imitating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe <hi>Angels,</hi> which, for ſo doing, were caſt downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and are now <hi>reſerved in everlaſting chaines vnder darknes vnto the iudgement of that great day,</hi> Iude, 1.6. and <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> who for ſo doing was expelled his palace, and made to <hi>eate graſſe with the beaſts of the forreſt,</hi> Dan. 4.32. and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> who for ſo doing, was brought out of his kingdome, and lodged <hi>in the red ſea</hi> among the fiſhes, Exod. 14.28.</p>
            <p>No ſinne hath pulled downe ſo many as this which promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſet vs vp. The firſt <hi>ſinne</hi> that conquered man, will be the

            </p>
            <p>Hence it is, that fleſh &amp; blood putteth ſuch confidence in it ſelfe. <hi>Naked we are,</hi> yet vaunt we our ſelues, as though we were gorgeouſly apparelled: <hi>weak we are,</hi> yet think we with <hi>Nimrod</hi> to build a tower to Heaven: <hi>ready are we to renounce Chriſt,</hi> yea dayly in deed we do renounce him, yet ſtoutly we proteſt with<note n="h" place="margin">Mat 26.35.</note>

            <p n="1">1 Let vs enter into a due conſideration of our eſtate, as it is by nature: which ſhall eaſily appeare vnto vs what it is, if we do but call to minde the metall whereof wee are made; the ſhortneſſe of our liues, and the miſeries to which wee are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>
            <p>Conſider we the metall whereof we are made. You know, it is no better then <hi>clay,</hi> no better then <hi>mire,</hi> no better then the

            <p>And conſider we the <hi>ſhortneſſe of our liues.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſt downe not others)</hi> the firſt thing we learne here, is, <hi>not to to diſgrace our neighbours.</hi> We that are Chriſtians and iourny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Heaven, muſt go, not ſo much <hi>by walking,</hi> as <hi>by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> not ſo much <hi>with our feet,</hi> as <hi>with our affections:</hi> neither is there any thing which maketh <hi>a good</hi> or <hi>a bad life,</hi> but <hi>a good</hi> or <hi>a bad loue.</hi> If therefore we will to Heaven by the right way, we muſt be rich in good works, we muſt be framed according to the rule of Goſpel-like perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; we muſt loue not our friends only <hi>in God,</hi> but our foes alſo <hi>for God.</hi> We preſume that fire is then hotteſt, when it warmeth them that are fartheſt of: ſo is it with <hi>loue;</hi> it is then moſt fervent and, perfect, when it forſaketh neither <hi>friend,</hi> nor <hi>foe,</hi> be they never ſo farre of. Is thy neighbor <hi>thy friend?</hi> Civility bids thee <hi>loue</hi> him; <hi>Is</hi> he <hi>thy foe?</hi> Chriſtianity forbids thee to diſgrace him. <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>foe,</hi> is he thy <hi>neighbour?</hi> Civillity then wils thee<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 7 12.</note> to <hi>doe vnto him,</hi> as <hi>thou wouldeſt bee done vnto;</hi> &amp; chriſtianity requireth of thee, that thou<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 19.19.</note> 
               <hi>loue him as thy ſelfe.</hi> Now think, how thou <hi>loveſt thy ſelfe:</hi> It is not with a <hi>feigned loue,</hi> not with a <hi>cold loue,</hi> not with <hi>temporary loue,</hi> not <hi>in word onely:</hi> therefore muſt thy <hi>loue</hi> towards thy neighbour, be <hi>vnfeigned,</hi> it muſt be <hi>fervent,</hi> it muſt be <hi>enduring,</hi> it muſt bee <hi>effectuall;</hi> adde hereto a fift condition; it muſt be holy, that is, thou muſt <hi>loue thy neighbour,</hi> you muſt loue one another, <hi>in God, for God,</hi> and <hi>to Gods glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ful meaſure of this our loue is ſet downe vnto vs by our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Ioan.</hi> 13.34. Who hath given vs a new comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>that we loue one another, as he hath loved vs, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1744:43"/> we loue one another:</hi> where we are willed in loving others, not ſo much to regard <hi>that loue,</hi> wherewith <hi>we loue our ſelues,</hi> as <hi>that,</hi> wherewith <hi>Chriſt loues vs.</hi> As he hath loved vs, even ſo muſt we loue one another. But how is that? Conſider with mee but 5. things, and you may learne how.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>the cauſe</hi> which moved <hi>Chriſt</hi> to loue vs. Wee haue beene<note n="o" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>choſen in him</hi> by the Father, that we might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, and therefore hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> loved vs with a <hi>peculiar loue</hi> aboue other men, Galat. 2.20. Therfore muſt we alſo loue our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>peculiarly</hi> in the Lord, for that very cauſe, becauſe (for ought we know) they are the <hi>elect</hi> and <hi>choſen of the Father in Chriſt,</hi> that they may be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>The time,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> loved vs. He loved vs <hi>firſt,</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.19. Therefore muſt we alſo prevent one another in loue; wee muſt not looke that they <hi>loue</hi> vs <hi>firſt</hi> (for the heathens can bee content to yeeld <hi>loue</hi> for <hi>loue,</hi> Mat. 5.46.) But we muſt <hi>loue</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>firſt,</hi> and by ſo <hi>loving them</hi> ſtirre them vp to <hi>loue vs</hi> againe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The <hi>quality</hi> of the perſons, whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath loved. He hath loved <hi>vs,</hi> Ioan. 15.9. vs: that is <hi>all,</hi> all the elect, Iewes, and Gentiles, Graecians, &amp; barbarians, bond, and free, men, &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the baſe, and poore as well, as the noble, and rich: for <hi>all which,</hi> and therfore for <hi>all vs</hi> he dyed, when as yet we were his enemies, when as yet <hi>we were ſinners,</hi> Rom. 5.8. Therfore muſt we alſo loue all men, be they <hi>ſinners,</hi> or ſeeme they <hi>iuſt;</hi> ſeeme they our <hi>friends</hi> or be they our <hi>foes,</hi> bee they of what eſtate and condition ſoever.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The <hi>end,</hi> for which Chriſt hath loued vs. <hi>He loued vs</hi> for no profit of his owne, but for our ſoules health. Therfore muſt we alſo loue our neighbours, not for our owne gaine, but for their good: and thereto doth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> counſell vs, <hi>Let every man be carefull for the things of his neighbour,</hi> Phil. 2.4.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The <hi>meaſure</hi> of Chriſts loue to vs ward. It is a <hi>true loue;</hi> for Chriſt is <hi>truth</hi> it ſelfe, Iohn. 14.6. It is an <hi>ardent loue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1744:43"/> 
               <hi>truly, earneſtly,</hi> &amp; <hi>conſtantly.</hi> We muſt abandon al <hi>falſe, feigned,</hi> and <hi>vaine loue,</hi> all <hi>corrupt</hi> loue, all <hi>gainefull</hi> loue, al <hi>tongue-loue,</hi> and the like, as <hi>Chriſt hath loued vs, even ſo muſt we loue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How this loue hath beene written in the hearts of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which long ſince haue ſlept in peace, their practiſes are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to declare.

            <p>
               <hi>Naomi</hi> might haue done her kinſeman all the diſgrace ſet downe in the law; ſhe might haue <hi>pulled of his</hi>

               <hi>impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> did chooſe rather to conceale it. The ſuppoſed father of Chriſt, that <hi>iust</hi> one, perceauing that his betrothed ſpouſe was with child before ever they came together, was minded to <hi>put her away</hi>

            <p>But all theſe are dead and gone, and (I feare me, I may to truely ſay it) their <hi>loue</hi> is alſo dead and gone with them. For if not ſo; could <hi>deceit,</hi> could <hi>bribery,</hi> could <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> could <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,</hi> could <hi>vſury,</hi> could many more ſuch adverſaries of <hi>true loue</hi> bee ſo common among vs, as they are?

            <p>There is a melodie may bee made in your heartes, to which only the Lord will liſten; and therefore <hi>Paule</hi> adviſeth you <hi>to make melody to the Lord in your hearts,</hi> Eph. 5.19. So Chriſt did, who ſaid it was <hi>meat</hi> &amp; <hi>drink</hi> to him, <hi>to doe</hi> his fathers <hi>will,</hi> Ioh. 4.34. &amp; ſo did <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>with all his might he danced before the Arke,</hi> 2.

            <p>Concerning therefore our firſt duty to our chiefeſt <hi>Maſter;</hi> our <hi>obedience</hi> conſiſteth in this: that we conforme <hi>our will</hi> to <hi>Gods will,</hi> with a reſolution <hi>to doe his will.</hi> Many are of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; many are of the <hi>ſeed of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which may not be called <hi>the children of Abraham.</hi> So <hi>S. Paule</hi> told the <hi>Romanes,</hi> chap. 9. ver. 6.7. So may I ſay here: many do <hi>will</hi> that which God <hi>willeth,</hi> who notwithſtanding conforme not their <hi>wils</hi> to Gods <hi>wil,</hi> neither can be ſaid <hi>to do his will.</hi> Where it ſhal not be much amiſſe for vs to examine, what it is, <hi>to frame our wils to Gods will,</hi> and what it is, <hi>to do his will:</hi> both which if wee will learne with a purpoſe to performe them, we ſhall in ſome good ſort diſcharge our firſt duty, we ſhall <hi>obey our Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath a <hi>will, which</hi> is holy, is pure, is perfect, eternall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting from all beginning; according to <hi>which,</hi> his doings are incomprehenſible, his iudgements ſecret, his waies paſt finding out: by <hi>which</hi> he ruleth all, he governeth all, he guideth and protecteth all: in <hi>which</hi> all things are, as they are. This <hi>will of God</hi> is alwaies fulfilled; no man hindreth it; no man ſtoppeth it. The Lord hath his decree aboue all the inhabitants of the earth, &amp; of the Sea, and whether they will or no, they muſt be obedient. If he call a <hi>bird from the East,</hi> that <hi>bird</hi> muſt come; if he ſpeake, he will bring it to paſſe; if he purpoſe, he will doe it, <hi>his counſell ſhall ſtand, he will doe whatſoever he will,</hi> Eſay, 46.20. <hi>According to his will, he worketh in the armie of Heaven, and in the inhabitants of the earth, &amp; none can ſtay his hand, nor ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, what doſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4.35.

No <hi>Annas,</hi> no <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> no <hi>Herod,</hi> no <hi>Pilate,</hi> no <hi>Iew,</hi> no <hi>Devill</hi> could haue wrought the death of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if the Lords ſecret <hi>will</hi> and <hi>counſell</hi> had not before determined, that it ſhould be done.</p>

            <p>God hath <hi>another will,</hi> which is manifeſted vnto vs, which I call <hi>another will,</hi> not as if it differed from the <hi>former</hi> in nature, (for Gods <hi>will</hi> is <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the ſame</hi>) but becauſe it remaines no longer <hi>hidden,</hi> as the <hi>former</hi> doth. For Gods <hi>will,</hi> as yet it is <hi>partly vnrevealed,</hi> is commonly called his <hi>hidden,</hi> or his <hi>ſecret
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1744:56"/> will:</hi> but as it is made knowne to vs, by the written word, and continuall ſucceſſe of things, ſo is it called the <hi>revealed will of God.</hi> And this is that <hi>will of God,</hi> to which wee muſt make like, faſhion, and frame <hi>our wills.</hi> And ſo ſhall we doe, if firſt we <hi>will</hi> nothing but what God <hi>willeth;</hi> then if <hi>will</hi> it in <hi>ſuch a ſort,</hi> as God would haue vs <hi>will</hi> it: and laſtly if <hi>for ſuch ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What God <hi>willeth,</hi> you cannot well (at leſt you ſhould not) be ignorant. The Scriptures teaching, that the beſt of you, is <hi>borne in iniquitie,</hi> and <hi>conceaved in ſinne,</hi> and <hi>feedeth vpon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſians,</hi> doe they not tell you, that God <hi>willeth</hi> the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your liues?

Thus may all in generall out of Gods word, and every one in particular, by ſuch things as daily befall him, and others, perceaue what Gods bleſſed <hi>will</hi> is; to which our <hi>wills</hi> muſt be framed after this manner.</p>
            <p>Our hearts muſt bee pure, and ſincere, without <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> without guile; all the powers and faculties of our ſoules and bodies muſt be inveſted with integritie, and that, not for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only, but for ever.

We muſt continue even vnto the end: our hearts muſt bee ſincere, they muſt bee pure, not for a ſeaſon only, but for ever: integritie muſt be in all our affections, not for a ſeaſon only, but for ever.</p>
            <p>And ſo muſt we reſpect two ends. The one, &amp; chiefeſt which is laſt, and is without end, is the <hi>glory of God:</hi> the other, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarie end, taking place in this life onely, is the <hi>profit of the Church.</hi> So then, if we <hi>will</hi> nothing, but what God <hi>willeth,</hi> and that with ſinceritie, integritie, and puritie of our hearts, our faith, our loue, and all other our affections, and that with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1744:57"/> with continuance even vnto the ende, and that for no other ends, but for the <hi>good of the Church</hi> while wee haue our abiding here, and here, and ever for <hi>Gods glory;</hi> wee may ſimply be ſaid to haue conformed our <hi>wils</hi> to Gods <hi>will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How neceſſary theſe conditions are for the framing of our <hi>wils</hi> to Gods <hi>will,</hi> you may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue by two vndoubted truths in divinitie.</p>
            <p>The firſt: Whoſoever <hi>willeth</hi> that, which God <hi>willeth,</hi> but doth it with another mind, with an vnpure heart, with corrupt affections, and for evill ends, he cannot be ſaid to haue confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his <hi>will</hi> to Gods <hi>will,</hi> but rather to haue done againſt his <hi>wil.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auſten <hi>in enchiridio ad Laurent. c.</hi> 101. ſets it down thus: <hi>Fieri poteſt, vt hoc velit homo voluntate malâ, quod Deus vult bonâ,</hi> a man may <hi>wickedly wil</hi> that, which God <hi>well willeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For example ſake; many a <hi>rich father</hi> hath a <hi>graceleſſe ſonne:</hi> this <hi>ſonne</hi> longeth for the inheritance, and therefore <hi>willeth</hi> his fathers death: God alſo <hi>willeth</hi> the ſame, and effecteth it. Thus we ſee our iuſt God, and a graceleſſe child willing one, and the ſame thing; yet, becauſe what God <hi>well willeth,</hi> that bad ſonne <hi>willeth wickedly,</hi> he cannot bee ſaid to haue conformed his <hi>will</hi> to Gods <hi>will,</hi> but rather to haue done againſt his <hi>wil.</hi> As alſo, when God was willing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould <hi>die,</hi> the Iewes, Pilat, and the Divell did <hi>wil</hi> the ſame; yet, becauſe what God <hi>willeth iuſtly,</hi> and <hi>lovingly,</hi> they did <hi>will wickedly,</hi> and <hi>hatefully,</hi> we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, wee may not ſay, that they conformed their <hi>wils</hi> to Gods <hi>will,</hi> but rather, that they did againſt his <hi>will.</hi> Albeit I doubt not of the truth of that which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auſten</hi> hath, concerning wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, that is; <hi>Dum faciunt contra voluntatem Dei, per ipſos impletur voluntas Dei.</hi> For it is a certaintie, that the children of darkneſſe, while they oppoſe themſelues againſt the <hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will</hi> of God, doe fulfill his <hi>ſecret will:</hi> yet becauſe they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues againſt Gods <hi>revealed will,</hi> not with a minde to fulfill his <hi>ſecret will,</hi> wee cannot, wee may not ſay, that they conforme their <hi>wils</hi> to Gods <hi>will;</hi> we muſt ſay, that <hi>they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond truth as vndoubted is this: Whoſoever <hi>willeth</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1744:57"/> that, which God <hi>willeth</hi> not, but doth it with a pure mind, with an vpright hart, with integrity of affections, &amp; for good ends he may truely bee ſaid to haue conformed his <hi>will</hi> to God <hi>will.

            </p>
            <p>So true is it, which <hi>S.

            <p>For to ſpeake ſimply &amp; without compariſon, I muſt ſay, as I ſaid before: if we <hi>will</hi> ſimply be ſaid, to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formed our <hi>wils</hi> to Gods <hi>will,</hi> we muſt <hi>will</hi> that, which God <hi>willeth,</hi> &amp; that with ſincerity, integrity, and purity of our <hi>hearts,</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> our <hi>loue,</hi> and all other our <hi>affections:</hi> and that with perſeverance, with continuance even vnto the end, and that for no other ends, but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1744:58"/> for the <hi>good of the Church</hi> while we haue our abiding here; and here and ever for the <hi>glory of our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we plainely ſee, what it is <hi>to conforme our wils to Gods will.</hi> Let vs now in like ſort conſider, what it is <hi>to doe</hi> his will.</p>
            <p>In which kind of ſpeech by the <hi>will of God</hi> is meant nothing elſe, but that, which God <hi>commaundeth</hi> vs to do: ſo that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>to do Gods will,</hi> is to performe ſuch things, as we are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> by him. That ſuch things are to be done, that they are to be performed, it cannot be doubted. But how they are to be done, and performed, that is the queſtion.</p>
            <p>Some are of opinion, that <hi>to do Gods will,</hi> is nothing elſe, but inwardly to be poſſeſſed with an hearty, &amp; earneſt deſire of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling his <hi>will;</hi> &amp; wholy to employ all the powers of our ſouls in the obſervance of his <hi>comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements.</hi> They aſcribe ſo much to the Godly purpoſes, and zealous affections of our minds, as that they thinke all <hi>externall fact,</hi> al <hi>outward obſervance</hi> altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needleſſe. And thus haue they thought, becauſe they find, that many haue beene ſaid to haue <hi>done the will of God,</hi> to haue <hi>walked in his waies,</hi> to haue <hi>done iudgement,</hi> and <hi>iuſtice,</hi> to haue kept their feet from treading in any evill path, and ſo to haue beene reputed for Saints, who notwithſtanding haue manie waies, and moſt grievouſly fallen. For they can tell you of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deniall,</hi> of <hi>Lots inceſt,</hi> of <hi>Salomons Idolatry,</hi> of <hi>Noahs drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,</hi> of <hi>Davids murther,</hi> of <hi>Sarahs lie,</hi> of <hi>Rebeccahs perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſonne Iacob to beguile his owne father,</hi> of the <hi>theft</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſimus,</hi> of the many <hi>Concubines</hi> of the patriarchs, and the like, of whoſe obedience to the <hi>will</hi> of God, we may not doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may not doubt of their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Which opinion of theirs, as I may not altogether reiect; ſo will I not ſimply allow of: for wee haue two propoſitions of certaine truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Externall obedience</hi> is neceſſary to the <hi>doing of the wil of God:</hi> and therefore that which they thinke, is not ſimplie to be allowed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the <hi>wil of God</hi> conſiſteth chiefly and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in our <hi>hearty,</hi> and <hi>earneſt deſire of doing it:</hi> and therfore
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1744:58"/> what they thinke, may not altogither be reiected.</p>
            <p>That <hi>outwarde obedience</hi> is neceſſary for our <hi>doing of Gods will,</hi> is ſo plaine, that it needs no proofe. For to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue God his <hi>commandements</hi> to be <hi>done?</hi> Was it not to <hi>man?</hi> Now who knoweth not, that <hi>man</hi> conſiſteth of a <hi>body,</hi> as well as of a <hi>ſoul?</hi> The <hi>body</hi> then is bound to obey, as well as the <hi>ſoule.</hi> The <hi>inward deſire</hi> ſerues not the turne: <hi>outward obedience</hi> muſt be practiſed. <hi>Outward obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> (I ſay not <hi>perfit,</hi> for that is impoſſible, do we all we can do, we ſhalbe <hi>vnprofitable ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts;</hi> yet I ſay) <hi>outward obedience</hi> muſt be practiſed. And therefore <hi>S. Paule</hi> hath beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched you to giue your <hi>bodies</hi> to God, Rom. 12.1. ſhewing that your <hi>bodies</hi> ſhould be Gods ſervants, as wel as your <hi>ſouls.</hi> Both are too little, one cannot be enough. Will you glorifie God in your <hi>ſouls</hi> you ſhal do wel: but glorifie him in your <hi>bodies</hi> too, 1. Cor. 6.20. Do your <hi>hearts</hi> beleeue, yet that is not enough; your <hi>monthes</hi> muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe too, Rom. 10.10. your <hi>tongues</hi> muſt be kept from evill, and your <hi>lips</hi> that they ſpeake no guile too, Pſal. 34.13. your <hi>eares</hi> muſt <hi>heare</hi> too, Matt. 11.15. your <hi>eies</hi> muſt behold the right too, Prov. 4.25. your <hi>hands</hi> muſt be lift vp to his ſanctuary too, Pſa. 134.2. your feet muſt be removed from evill too, Prov 4.27. The ſumme of all is: you muſt giue your <hi>bodies</hi> a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to God. Now a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> (as you know) is wherein <hi>all the members</hi> are offered together, Levit. 1.9. &amp; 13. Therefore muſt you giue your <hi>members</hi> alſo to God. Your <hi>eies,</hi> your <hi>eares,</hi> your <hi>tongues,</hi> your <hi>hands,</hi> your <hi>feet,</hi> with all the reſt, muſt be emploied in the ſervice of God. For he who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you to loue the LORD with <hi>al your ſoule,</hi> and with <hi>al your minde,</hi> Deut. 6.5. hath commanded you alſo to loue him with <hi>all your ſtrength;</hi> to teach you, that the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of your <hi>handes, eies,</hi> and <hi>eares,</hi> and every other <hi>part</hi> of you, muſt wholy be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in his ſervice. And therefore as we would be changed in our <hi>thoughes,</hi> ſo muſt we alſo be changed in our <hi>wordes,</hi> ſo muſt we be changed in our <hi>works;</hi> we muſt be carefull that our <hi>tongues</hi> ſpeake no more idely; that our <hi>eies</hi> behold no more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that our <hi>eares</hi> heare no more folly; that our <hi>hands</hi> worke no more iniquitie: and as oft as we ſhall go about the ſervice
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1744:59"/> of God, which we cannot do to oft; everie one of vs ſhould cal all his <hi>powers</hi> togither, and ſaie with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 103.1. <hi>My ſoule, praiſe thou the</hi> Lord, <hi>and all that is within me, praiſe his holy name.</hi> And thus much of the firſt propoſition, of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our <hi>outward obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond propoſition, if you remember was this: <hi>The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the will of God, conſiſteth cheifly and eſpecially in our hearty and earneſt deſire of doing it.</hi> The proofe hereof is eaſy: The chiefeſt part of man is his <hi>minde,</hi> therfore the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> eſpeciallie conſiſteth in the <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>intents</hi> of the <hi>minde:</hi> and it ſo conſiſteth in theſe affections, that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the elect (who only <hi>beleeue in Chriſt,</hi> and alone may be ſaid <hi>to do Gods will</hi>) God reſteth contented with this <hi>inwarde deſire,</hi> as long as this fleſh encombreth them. All other imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are not imputed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This godly purpoſe &amp; earneſt deſire of doing Gods wil ſtands them in ſteed. For it is ſo grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, as that he accepteth this <hi>begun</hi> obedience for <hi>moſt perfit.</hi> And reckons of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are thus <hi>obedient,</hi> as if they had <hi>kept the whole law;</hi> which he ſo doth, not for this their <hi>deſire,</hi> not for this their <hi>begun obedience,</hi> but becauſe by <hi>faith</hi> they are <hi>engrafted into Chriſt.</hi> So chiefly the fulfilling of Gods wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in our <hi>inward obedience,</hi> but not wholy.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but that <hi>Hezekiah truſted in the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, ſo that after him was none like him among all the kings of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, neither were there any ſuch before him; for hee claue to the Lord and departed not from him, but kept his commaundements, which the Lord had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded Moſes:</hi> for ſo we read, 2. Kin. 18.5, 6. yet we read alſo that this ſame <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did ſome things, which pleaſed not the Lord, 2. King. 20.13. Neither may I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that <hi>Ioſiah</hi> did <hi>vprightly in the ſight of the Lord:</hi> for ſo it is written, 2. King. 22.2. yet it is written alſo, that this <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> would not obey the word of God. 2. Chron. 35.22. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I denie, but that <hi>David</hi> fulfilled the will of the Lord, for he is bold to ſaie of himſelfe; O Lord <hi>I haue refrained my feete fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> every evil way,</hi> &amp; <hi>haue not declined fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy iudgements,</hi> O Lord, Pſal. 119.101, 102. yet his notorious <hi>murther</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:1744:59"/> are witneſſes of his not fulfilling the will of God. So then of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> I may ſay, that they haue <hi>fulfilled the will of God,</hi> becauſe with integritie of <hi>inward affections</hi> they haue deſired the <hi>fulfilling</hi> thereof: but to ſay that abſolutely, and ſimply they haue done this will of God, I may not, I dare not open my mouth. <hi>If thou,</hi> O Lord, <hi>ſhalt mark what is done amiſſe,</hi> O Lord, <hi>who is able to abide it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this then be our reſolution concerning this point: the holy Scriptures by this ſpeech, by this phraſe <hi>(to doe the will of God)</hi> doe ſignifie <hi>perfect obedience</hi> of the whole man towards God, <hi>perfect obedience</hi> both of body and ſoule: yet becauſe the chiefeſt part of this <hi>obedience</hi> is rooted in the <hi>minde,</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie by the ſame phraſe ſignifieth, that hee is willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>readineſſe</hi> of our <hi>minds,</hi> if it bee ioyned with <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for moſt <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to the Law. And I adde this; howſoever the Lord will accept the integritie of our mindes, when it is ioyned with faith in Chriſt, for <hi>perfect obedience,</hi> yet he requireth <hi>the perfect obedience</hi> both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let vs lay theſe things to our owne hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſee, whether we haue conformed our <hi>wils</hi> to the <hi>will of God,</hi> with a reſolution <hi>to doe it;</hi> whether wee haue performed <hi>our obedience</hi> to our <hi>great Maſter.</hi> To iudge of your heartes is not within the compaſſe of my commiſſion: yet, if it bee true, that a<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 6.43.</note> 
               <hi>good tree</hi> cannot bring forth <hi>bad fruit;</hi> if it bee true, that<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 7.16.</note> 
               <hi>grapes</hi> growe not of <hi>thornes,</hi> nor <hi>figges</hi> of <hi>thiſtles;</hi> then may I boldly ſay, that your <hi>wils</hi> are not conformed to the <hi>will of God</hi> that you haue much failed of that <hi>obedience,</hi> which your <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> hath enioyned you.</p>
            <p>The Prophet Hoſeah. 4.1.2. told the <hi>Iewes</hi> that the LORD had a <hi>controverſie</hi> with them; becauſe there was <hi>no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in their land;</hi> becauſe by <hi>ſwearing</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>killing,</hi> and <hi>ſtealing,</hi> and <hi>whoring,</hi> they <hi>breake out,</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> touched <hi>blood.</hi> Whether this ſame complaint may iuſtly be made of you, I appeale to yourſelues, as <hi>iudges.</hi> It may be your cheekes will bee redd to talke of Chriſt, as theirs were who went to<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 23.13.</note> 
               <hi>Emaus,</hi> and you will bluſh apace to ſeeme ſo
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1744:60"/> holy; but ſay, will not the <hi>black-moore bluſh</hi> faſter then you, when fearefully and fowly you <hi>ſinne</hi> againſt the Lord? Is there any <hi>delight</hi> more <hi>wicked</hi> then other? we are by and by deſirous to <hi>wallow</hi> in it, to <hi>tumble</hi> in it, to <hi>ioy</hi> in it, to <hi>liue</hi> and <hi>growe old</hi> in it. So bath we in all pleaſure and eaſe <hi>this mater of earth,</hi> and <hi>wormes meat,</hi> wherewith we are clogged, as if there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>corruption</hi> to <hi>rot</hi> it, nor <hi>Heaven</hi> to receaue it, nor <hi>Hell</hi> to <hi>burne</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Hence is it, that we are <hi>dead in ſleepe,</hi> and <hi>watch not at all</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſoules of our children, our ſervants, and all others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to our goverments; who, (were they rightly trained vp by vs in the grounds of Chriſtian religion) might happely grow vp like <hi>to glorious oliues,</hi> for the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; <hi>Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read Gen. 31.53. that when <hi>Laban</hi> ſwore by his falſe Gods, then <hi>Iacob</hi> ſwore by the feare of his father <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent was the inſtruction given him by his father, that in the preſence of <hi>Idolatrous Laban,</hi> neither for feare, nor favour would he alter his religion: yea, it was ſo faſtned in him, that, having been 20. years among the <hi>Idolatrous Syrians,</hi> he cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged not the <hi>maner of the oath,</hi> which hee learned of his <hi>father.</hi> Are our <hi>fathers</hi> ſo carefull, to teach their <hi>children</hi> in <hi>religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> Indeed, if to bee <hi>skilfull</hi> in oathes be to be <hi>religious,</hi> I cannot finde fault with their nurturing. But ſo they ſhould not learne <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time was, when ſervants prayed to the <hi>God</hi> of their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> Gen. 24.42. But in theſe daies if they ſhould doe ſo; ſome muſt pray vnto <hi>pride,</hi> ſome to <hi>coveteouſneſſe,</hi> ſome to <hi>gluttony,</hi> moſt to <hi>ignorance.</hi> Now may we ſay, as commonly is ſaid: <hi>like ſervant, like Maſter,</hi> if <hi>one</hi> loue the wicked, the <hi>other</hi> will loth the godly; <hi>like father, like ſonne,</hi> if <hi>one</hi> ſell vertue, the <hi>other</hi> will buy ſinne; <hi>like Prieſt, like people,</hi> if <hi>one</hi> freeze in loue, the <hi>other</hi> will boyle in malice: <hi>as the governour is, ſo are they that are ruled;</hi> if <hi>one</hi> refuſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> will chooſe <hi>Barabbas: ſuch as the ſeed is, ſuch is the harveſt;</hi> every one layeth away life, and playeth with death.</p>
            <p>Yet let the <hi>children of Abraham,</hi> doe like <hi>Abraham,</hi> let them <hi>teach</hi> their ſonnes, their daughters, their ſervants, their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1744:60"/> people, and al that are ruled by them, <hi>the covenants of the Lord;</hi> let them teach them <hi>to conforme their wils to the will of God;</hi> let them teach them <hi>to doe his will;</hi> let them teach them <hi>perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoule.</hi> So they with all their ſeed, and poſteritie, ſhal be bleſſed, not only in this life with a temporall promiſe, but alſo in the life to come with that ever during pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that they ſhall bee inheritours of the kingdome of God. Of which promiſe, vouchſafe, good Lord, to make vs all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers through faith in Chriſt Ieſus, to whom with thee, and the holy Ghoſt, three perſons and one God, be rendred all praiſe, power, maieſtie, and dominion, for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>Behold, they ſhall be as ſtubble, the fire ſhall burne them, they ſhall not deliver their owne liues from the power of the flame,</hi> yea they ſhalbe ſo conſumed with the flaming fire, as that there ſhall not be anie thing remaining, no not to much as one <hi>coale to warme at,</hi> nor anie <hi>light to ſit by.</hi>

            <p>By this I doubt not, but it appeareth, what <hi>affiance</hi> may bee had in all <hi>worldly helps,</hi> of what ſort ſoever.

            </p>
            <p>A third motiue to the ſame perſwaſion, of no leſſe weight then the two former, then that of Gods <hi>preſence,</hi> &amp; the other of his <hi>liberalitie,</hi> is his <hi>abilitie;</hi> of which the ſchoolemen in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall teach thus: That <hi>God is abſolutely Almightie.</hi> In this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1744:69"/> they all agree, but when they come to ſcanne, how God may be ſaid to be thus <hi>Almightie,</hi> they vary much.</p>
            <p>Some ſay that <hi>God</hi> is therefore ſaid to be <hi>Almightie,</hi> becauſe <hi>he is able to doe, whatſoever he will doe.</hi> Theſe doe ſo tie Gods <hi>power</hi> to his <hi>will,</hi> as if he were <hi>able to do nothing,</hi> but what <hi>his wil is to doe.</hi> But S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
               <hi>Auſtine</hi> was of another mind in Enchirid. c. 95. where he ſaith, <hi>Deum multa poſſe, quae tamen nolit, nihil autem velle, quod non poſſit.</hi> God is <hi>able</hi> to doe many things, which hee willeth not; but <hi>willeth</hi> not any thing, which he is not <hi>able</hi> to doe: plainely ſhewing, that Gods <hi>will</hi> &amp; <hi>power</hi> are not equall; that his <hi>power</hi> is extended to more things, then his <hi>will:</hi> that thoſe things which God is <hi>able</hi> to doe, are more then thoſe things which he <hi>willeth.</hi> The Scriptures alſo doe confirme this difference of Gods <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power. Thinkeſt thou,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that I cannot pray now to my Father, and he will giue me more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twelue legions of Angels?</hi> Mat. 26.53. Chriſt was <hi>able to aske</hi> his Father, and his Father was <hi>able to giue</hi> him that hoſt of Angels, but neither <hi>would</hi> he <hi>aske,</hi> nor his father <hi>giue. God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe vp children vnto Abraham,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Mat. 3.9. He is <hi>able,</hi> but <hi>will not. God hath mercy on whom he will haue mercy, and whom hee will hee hardneth,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Roman. 9.18. Is it not herehence plaine, that God is <hi>able</hi> to haue mercy on all, and is <hi>able</hi> to harden all, but <hi>will not?</hi> So true is it, againſt the firſt opinion, That <hi>God is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to be Almightie, becauſe he is able to doe, whatſoever he will doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others are of opinion that <hi>God is therefore ſaide too bee Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, becauſe he is abſolutly &amp; ſimply able to do al things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or thought of.</hi> If you ſhal aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether God <hi>can ſin,</hi> their anſwer is, he <hi>can,</hi> but <hi>wil not:</hi> if, whether he <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffer,</hi> they ſay he <hi>can,</hi> but <hi>will not:</hi> if whether he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>lie,</hi> they ſay, <hi>he can,</hi> but <hi>wil not.</hi> But this opinion is, as more wicked, ſo more fooliſh then the former. For to ſay that God is <hi>able</hi> to doe ſuch things, as are repugnant to his nature is, as to ſay, the fire is <hi>able</hi> to cauſe cold, the Sun to make darkneſſe, &amp; a bad tree to bring forth good fruit. But <hi>S. Paule</hi> hath not feared to ſay that God
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1744:69"/> 
               <hi>cannot do</hi> ſome things, 2. Timoth. 2.13. He ſaith, <hi>If we beleeue not, yet abideth he faithfull,</hi> yet abideth God faithfull, <hi>he cannot deny himſelfe:</hi> he ſaith not, <hi>he will not deny himſelfe,</hi> but plainely he ſaith, <hi>he cannot deny himſelfe.</hi> And why <hi>can he not deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?</hi> The reaſon is ſet downe before: becauſe <hi>he is faithfull.</hi> He is <hi>faithful, non tam voluntate, quam naturà</hi> the is <hi>naturally faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> and therfore <hi>can he not deny himſelfe.</hi> I adde; he is <hi>naturally living,</hi> and therefore <hi>cannot die;</hi> hee is <hi>naturally righteous,</hi> and therefore <hi>cannot ſinne;</hi> he is <hi>naturally immutable,</hi> and therefore <hi>cannot be changed;</hi> hee is <hi>naturally God,</hi> and therefore <hi>cannot be like man. Quam mult a non poteſt, &amp; omnipotens eſt?</hi> Here is matter to wonder at; God cannot do many things, &amp; yet he is Almighty: yea becauſe he cannot do thoſe many things, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he Almighty. For could he die, he were not Almighty; could he ly, he were not Almighty; could he be deceived, could he deceiue, could he do wickedly, he were not Almighty. <hi>Qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> multa non poteſt Deus, &amp; omnipotens eſt?</hi> How many things is God <hi>not able to do,</hi> and yet is <hi>Almighty,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Auſtine de Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo ad Catechumenos, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. So true is it againſt this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond opinion, that <hi>God is not therefore ſaid to bee Almighty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is abſolutely and ſimply able to doe all things, whatſoever may be spoken or thought of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is God ſaid to be Almighty? Out of that which is already delivered, this propoſition may be gathered; <hi>God is therefore ſaid to bee Almighty, becauſe he is able to do all ſuch things, as naturally in themſelues, and ſimply, are not impoſſible with God.</hi> The truth whereof, as it might evidently appeare by particulars, whereon I cannot now ſtand; ſo alſo may it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be manifeſt, if in generall only we will conſider this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe</hi> of God. I deny not, but earthly man, hard to beleeue the workes of God, in mans eies vnprobable, hath ever beene ready to demand, How? How can this, or theſe things bee? An <hi>Angell</hi> from heaven may tell <hi>Sarah</hi> of a ſonne, after it hath ceaſed to be with her <hi>after the manner of women;</hi> but ſhee will <hi>laugh</hi> within her ſelfe: but ſhee wil ſay, <hi>what! after I am waxen old,</hi> and my Lord alſo!

            <p>Diſtruſtfull men, to ſatisfie our ſelues in ſuch diſtruſtful rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings. Heare we what <hi>S.

            <p>The <hi>promiſes</hi> of God, made vnto the ſonnes of men, in the word of God are of two ſorts: either they haue <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> annexed vnto them, or elſe they are without <hi>condition:</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is Gods power to ſalvation to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Ahiiah</hi> the prophet had foretold <hi>Ieroboam</hi> of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow; namely, that God would <hi>ſweepe away</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1. Kin. 14.10</note> 
               <hi>the remnant of his houſe,</hi> as <hi>a man ſweepeth away dunge till it be all gone:</hi> that of his ſtocke none ſhould <hi>die in the city,</hi> but the <hi>dogs ſhould eat;</hi> none in the <hi>fields,</hi> but the <hi>fowles</hi> ſhould pray vpon: that there ſhould a <hi>king</hi> come <hi>over Iſrael,</hi> to ſet abroach all thoſe evils; vnwilling to leaue any hope, that this time was not yet to come, that it was far of removed; he correcteth himſelfe with ſuddaine and quicke demaund, and maketh the anſwere vnto it; <hi>what?</hi> (ſaith he) Yea, <hi>eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now,</hi> 1. Kin. 14.14. as if he had ſaid, what? ſaid I, it ſhould come to paſſe thus, or thus? Yea <hi>even now</hi> it is come to paſſe, it is already done. What this Prophet hath ſpoken concerning the Lords threatnings againſt <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> may be verified of all the promiſes of the Lord: ſuch is their certainety, ratified by the Lords owne wordes: <hi>My covenant will I not breake, nor alter any thing, that is gone out of my lippes,</hi> Pſal. 89.34. confirmed, by his <hi>viſiting of Sarah, as he had ſaide, and doing vnto her, according as he had promiſed,</hi> Gen. 21.1. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of by <hi>Ioſhua's</hi> conſent, when he told the <hi>Iſraëlites,</hi> that <hi>there had failed nothing of all the good things, which the Lord had ſaid vnto them,</hi> but <hi>all came to paſſe,</hi> Ioſh. 23.14. What? ſhall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1744:71"/> I ſay then, that Gods promiſes <hi>ſhall be fulfilled?</hi> Yea, <hi>even now; even now</hi> they are come to paſſe, they are fulfilled already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath ſpoken once,</hi> and <hi>I haue heard it twice, that power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 62.11. and ſo let mee ſay, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, and I haue heard it twice, that truth belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto God.</hi> God is very <hi>conſtant</hi> in the performance of his <hi>promiſes.</hi> To driue it into our conceits hee hath ſpoken it, <hi>once and twice:</hi> not <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>once and twice,</hi> many times; he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it eternally, vnmoueably, effectually, without revokeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: <hi>once</hi> in the law, and <hi>againe, &amp; againe</hi> in the Goſpell. This ſweet milke may be ſuckt plentifully out of both the breaſtes of the Church, out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and out of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> out of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp; out of the <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> out of the <hi>Law,</hi> and out of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> O happy are they, that feed only on this milke.</p>
            <p>It is commonly ſaid, that <hi>truth</hi> cannot paſſe forth without contrarieties, and quarrels of iudgement. And ſo is it here. The <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>neverfading truth</hi> of his <hi>promiſes,</hi> hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beene encombred with doubts. This doubt hath eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beene made: <hi>How it may ſtand with the conſtancie, &amp; truth of the eternall God, to pronounce a iudgement againſt any man, or place, and not effect it?</hi> or, <hi>to repent for any thing hee hath done, or hath promiſed to doe hereafter?</hi> For if it bee plaine that God fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in bringing to paſſe his iudgements and threatnings, how can I aſſure my ſelfe, that he will be <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> in his <hi>mercies,</hi> and <hi>promiſes?</hi> if it bee plaine that hee <hi>repenteth</hi> for any thing that hee hath done, or hath promiſed to doe hereafter, how can I aſſure my ſelfe, that he will not <hi>repent</hi> of thoſe <hi>good promiſes,</hi> which I account of, as made vnto my ſelfe?</p>
            <p>Now, who knoweth not, how the Lord <hi>repented for making man on the earth?</hi> Gen. 6.6. how hee <hi>repented</hi> for making <hi>Saule King?</hi> 1. Sam. 15.11. and how he promiſed to <hi>repent of good</hi> or <hi>evill,</hi> accordingly as man ſhould repent of, or hold on, his evil? Ier. 18.7, 8, 9, 10. The LORD ſaid vnto <hi>Abimelech, Thou art but a dead man, becauſe of the woman which thou haſt taken,</hi> Gen. 20.3. yet the event fell out otherwiſe, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> was purged with God. The LORD ſaid to ſicke <hi>Hezekias,</hi> put
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1744:72"/> 
               <hi>thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not liue,</hi> Eſai, 38.1. yet did <hi>Hezechias</hi> liue fifteene yeares after. The LORD would haue it proclaimed in the ſtreets of <hi>Nineveh, Yet fortie daies &amp; Nineveh ſhal be deſtroyed,</hi> Ion. 3.4. yet did <hi>Nineveh</hi> eſcape that plunge, and was reſerved to vnderſtand of her finall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the miniſtery of <hi>Nahum.</hi> Theſe places, and the like inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating in ſome ſort both <hi>repentance,</hi> and alſo <hi>change</hi> of minde and purpoſe in the LORD of Heauen may be ſome cauſe of the former doubt. For ſatisfying whereof diverſe haue anſwered diverſely.</p>
            <p>Some anſwer thus: As the <hi>spirit</hi> is ſaid <hi>to make requeſt for vs with ſighes that cannot be expreſſed,</hi> Rom. 8.26. ſo may God bee ſaid <hi>to repent himſelfe.</hi> Now the holy ſpirit cannot bee ſaid to <hi>cry,</hi> as if <hi>it ſelfe did crie,</hi> or to <hi>pray,</hi> as if <hi>it ſelfe did pray,</hi> or to <hi>ſigh,</hi> as if <hi>it ſelfe did ſigh;</hi> but becauſe it ſtirreth in the <hi>Saints of God</hi> ſuch affections; and maketh them to <hi>cry,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> and to <hi>ſigh.</hi> And ſo they vnderſtand that other place of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 4.30. <hi>Grieue not the holy spirit,</hi> that is, ſay they, take heed that by your wicked living, yee offend not the <hi>Saints of God,</hi> in whom the <hi>holy spirit</hi> dwelleth. In their application they ſay, that God may then be ſaid <hi>to repent,</hi> when he maketh <hi>his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> in whom he dwelleth, <hi>to repent</hi> for their ſinnes.</p>
            <p>But this expoſition, albeit in ſome places it may haue good vſe, as in thoſe before cited <hi>of the holy ſpirit:</hi> yet may it not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be applyed to all ſuch places, wherein God is ſaid to <hi>repent.</hi> It <hi>repented</hi> God that <hi>he made man,</hi> Gen. 6.6. Here this ſenſe may not bee admitted: to ſay, it <hi>repented man</hi> that God made <hi>him:</hi> for it <hi>repented God himſelfe,</hi> that he made <hi>man.</hi> It <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented</hi> God alſo, that hee had made <hi>Saul</hi> king, 1. Sam. 15.11. neither here may this ſenſe be admitted, to ſay; it <hi>repented Saul</hi> that God had made <hi>him</hi> King: for it <hi>repented God himſelfe</hi> that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King. I will ſpeake ſuddenly <hi>against a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or againſt a kingdome to plucke it vp, to root it out, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it;</hi> but <hi>if this nation againſt whom I haue pronounced, turne from their wickedneſſe, I will repent of the plague, that I thought to bring vpon them,</hi> ſaith the Lord, Ierem. 18.7. nor here may
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1744:72"/> this ſenſe bee admitted, to ſay; <hi>the people ſhould repent</hi> of the plague, which the Lord had thought to bring vpon <hi>them:</hi> for it is <hi>God himſelfe, that will repent</hi> of the plague, which hee had thought to bring vpon the people. I deny not, but God may truely be ſaid, to doe that which hee maketh vs to doe; but to ſay, whatſoever God may be ſaid <hi>to doe,</hi> therefore hee may bee ſaid <hi>to doe it,</hi> becauſe he <hi>maketh vs to doe it;</hi> this is vtterly to be denyed.</p>
            <p>Others anſwer thus: God may then bee ſaid <hi>to repent,</hi> and to <hi>change his mind,</hi> when <hi>things themſelues be changed.</hi> For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſake: as long as men ly wallowing in their ſinnes, <hi>the wrath of God,</hi> Gods ſcourges ſhal be vpon them: ſuch is <hi>the wil of God</hi> revealed in the Law. But when men ſhall <hi>repent them of their ſinnes</hi> committed, God alſo ſhall <hi>repent</hi> him of his fore-threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned plagues; when men ſhall be <hi>changed,</hi> there ſhal be a <hi>change</hi> alſo, not in the <hi>will of God;</hi> for that is impoſſible; but in the wrath of God: his curſes ſhall be turned to bleſſings. And this ſenſe is tolerable in the place before cited, Ierem. 18.7, 8. <hi>I will ſpeake ſuddainely againſt a nation, or againſt a kingdome to pluck it vp, to root it out, and to deſtroy it: but if this nation againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue pronounced, turne from their wickedneſſe, I will repent of the plague, that I thought to bring vpon them;</hi> becauſe <hi>they are changed,</hi> from worſe to better, <hi>my curſe ſhall bee changed</hi> into a bleſſing: <hi>I wil repent of the plague, that I thought to bring vpon them.</hi> And in the 2. verſes following; 9, 10. he ſaith, <hi>I will speake ſuddenly concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdome, to build it, and to plant it; but if it doe evill in my ſight, and heare not my voice, I will repent of the good, that I haue thought to do for them:</hi> becauſe <hi>they are changed</hi> from better to worſe, <hi>my bleſſing</hi> ſhall alſo <hi>be changed into a curſe; I will repent of the good that I haue thought to doe for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This expoſition howſoever it be naturall to this place, may not generally be fitted to all other places. I deny hot, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>men repent</hi> themſelues of their ſinnes committed, but that <hi>Gods ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> in regard of any <hi>eternall</hi> puniſhment to bee inflicted on them, <hi>ſhall be changed;</hi> but to ſay, that his <hi>ſentence</hi> in regard of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1744:73"/> 
               <hi>temporary</hi> puniſhments ſhall bee <hi>changed,</hi> is more then I dare, as long as I thinke of the <hi>continuall afflictions,</hi> wherewith god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hearts haue dayly beene tryed.</p>
            <p>Others anſwere thus: God may be ſaid <hi>to repent,</hi> as he is ſaid <hi>to be angry,</hi> &amp; <hi>ielouſe.</hi> Where we may note that theſe attributs, and all other like theſe, muſt be taken <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if they were vſed for mans eaſier vnderſtanding. It is a common thing for God, in his holy word to apply himſelfe to our capacities, and to attribute to himſelfe ſuch things, as are vſuall in the courſe of our liues. For inſtance: becauſe men vſe not <hi>to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on others,</hi> except they be <hi>angry,</hi> therefore when God <hi>revengeth</hi> our wickedneſſe, he is ſaid <hi>to bee angry.</hi> Againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men by their <hi>exceeding care</hi> they haue <hi>to keepe their wiues chaſt,</hi> doe get to be called <hi>iealous:</hi> therefore God caring in like ſort <hi>to keepe his spouſe chaſt,</hi> to preſerue his Church ſpotleſſe, is called alſo <hi>Ielous.</hi> So is it here. Becauſe men vſe not <hi>to change</hi> their former purpoſes &amp; intents, except it <hi>repenteth them,</hi> that they had ſo purpoſed and intended before; therefore God is ſaid alſo <hi>to repent,</hi> when he altereth not his <hi>will,</hi> for that is <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable;</hi> not his <hi>decree,</hi> for that <hi>cannot bee altered;</hi> but the <hi>thing</hi> which he had <hi>promiſed,</hi> or <hi>threatned.</hi> Thus is God truely ſaid <hi>to repent,</hi> according to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Auſtines</hi> diſcourſe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 83. <hi>quaſt. quae..</hi> 5.2.</p>
            <p>Now, touching the word of the Lord, which came to <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech, Hezechiah,</hi> and <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and was not fulfilled, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to carnall eies might ſeeme to make much againſt the <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So writes <hi>S. Auſtine</hi> to <hi>Marcellium:</hi> The husbandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>at one time</hi> ſoweth, <hi>at another time</hi> moweth, <hi>as a third time</hi> du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his fields: according to the diverſity of times, <hi>his workes are changed.</hi> Shal we ſay then, that the art of husbandry is cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? No: nor yet the <hi>will</hi> of the husbandman.

            </p>
            <p>Some teach thus: the <hi>decrees,</hi> and <hi>purpoſes</hi> of God conſiſt of two parts: the one whereof God <hi>revealeth</hi> at the firſt, and the other he <hi>concealeth</hi> a while, &amp; keepeth in his own knowledge: as in the action enioined to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gods purpoſe was two-fold, 1. <hi>To try his obedience,</hi> 2. <hi>To ſaue the childe:</hi> and if any ſhal impute it to vnconſtancie thus to <hi>bid,</hi> and <hi>vnbid,</hi> he may know that the <hi>will</hi> of the Lord was not fully vnderſtood in the firſt part.

            <p>Others teach thus: In moſt of the Lords <hi>threatnings</hi> there is a <hi>conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> annexed,</hi> which alwaies is not expreſt, but ſomtimes vnderſtood: and it is, as <hi>hinges to adore;</hi> it turnes forwards or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1744:74"/> backwards the whole matter. Where we muſt not forget, that a conditionall ſentence putteth no certainty; <hi>nihil ponit in eſſe,</hi> as the ſchoolemen ſpeake; it forceth nothing, but accordingly as the <hi>condition</hi> ſhall be either broken, or kept. The Lord ſaide to <hi>Abimelech: Thou art but a dead man,</hi> his meaning was; <hi>except thou reſtore to Abraham his wife: Sarah</hi> was reſtored, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> purged with God. The Lord ſaid to <hi>Hezechiah, Put thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not liue,</hi> his meaning was; <hi>except thou be humbled before me</hi> by praier: <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was humbled, and lived fifteene yeares after. The Lord would haue it proclaimed in the ſtreets of <hi>Nineveh, Yet</hi> 40. <hi>daies, and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroied:</hi> his meaning was, <hi>except Nineveh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: Nineveh repented,</hi> and was reſerved to vnderſtand of her finall deſtruction by the miniſtery of <hi>Nahum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, I hope, that the afore-cited places are anſwered, and that the doubt ariſing from them is cleared. So it remaineth, that we beleeue Gods promiſes to be certaine, full of conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and full of truth. It was <hi>Balaams</hi> confeſſion: <hi>God is not as man, that he ſhould lie, neither as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it?</hi> and <hi>hath he spoken, and ſhall he not accompliſh it?</hi> Num. 23.19. It was <hi>Samuels</hi> confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; <hi>Indeed the ſtrength of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not lie, nor repent: for he is not as man, that he ſhould repent,</hi> 1. Sam. 15.29. It was Gods own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel ſhall ſtand, my wil ſhall be done: as I haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo wil I bring it paſſe; as I haue purpoſed, ſo wil I do,</hi> Eſai. 46.10.11.</p>
            <p>If for <hi>Balaams</hi> confeſſion, if for <hi>Samuels</hi> confeſſion, if for <hi>God</hi> his owne proteſtation, we will not beleeue the certainety of <hi>Gods promiſes,</hi> what ſhall I ſay? Surely that the ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, which poſſeſſed <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, hath alſo poſſeſſed ours. He was <hi>preached vnto,</hi> not only in the name of the Lord, and with kinde exhortation, as:<note n="a" place="margin">Exod 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>Let my people go:</hi> not only by threats, &amp; ſentences of iudgment, but alſo by apparent <hi>plagues</hi> (and what <hi>preaching</hi> can be more effectuall?) by<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. c. 8. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>frogs,</hi> by <hi>lice,</hi> by <hi>flies,</hi> by <hi>graſhoppers: morraine, botches, darkneſſe, haileſtones, blood,</hi> &amp; <hi>death</hi> it ſelfe, were arguments of perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But could all theſe things moue him? No: but <hi>the firſt time</hi> he returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1744:75"/> his houſe and <hi>hardned</hi> his heart; <hi>the ſecond time</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw he had reſt, he <hi>hardned</hi> his heart againe: <hi>the third time</hi> his heart remained <hi>obſtinate;</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>the fourth time</hi> (though eſpecial warning was given him, as: <hi>Let not Pharaoh from hence forth deceiue me any more;</hi>) yet this <hi>fourth time</hi> he returned into his houſe and <hi>hardned</hi> his heart againe.</p>
            <p>We alſo haue been daily <hi>preached vnto,</hi> not only in the name of the Lord, and with kinde exhortation, as; <hi>Amend your liues for the kingdome of God is at hand;</hi> not only by <hi>threats,</hi> and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of iudgement;</hi> but alſo by apparent <hi>plagues</hi> (&amp; what <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> can be more effectual?) by <hi>warre,</hi> by <hi>ſickeneſſe,</hi> by <hi>famine,</hi> as ſo many arguments of perſwaſion. But could al theſe things moue vs? No: but the firſt time from this place and the like, we returned to our houſes, &amp; <hi>hardned</hi> our hearts: the ſecond time when we ſaw wee had reſt, we <hi>hardned</hi> our hearts againe; the third time our <hi>hearts</hi> remained <hi>obſtinate;</hi> &amp; likewiſe the fourth time,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> (though eſpeciall warning were given vs, as: <hi>Curſed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, that continueth not in all things, which are written in the booke of the law, to do them)</hi> yet this fourth time alſo, haue we returned to our houſes, and <hi>hardned</hi> our hearts againe: and ſo returne we ſtill, and <hi>harden</hi> our hearts ſtill, as if we meant to build vp <hi>incredulity,</hi> as high as ever <hi>Babel</hi> was intended, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to Heaven, and there to defie <hi>God</hi> to his face.</p>
            <p>What may be thought of this? Even what <hi>S. Paule</hi> hath ſaid, 2. Theſſ. 3.2. <hi>All men haue not faith.</hi> If we looke to the infancie of the world, God ſent his <hi>Patriarches,</hi> and found <hi>not faith:</hi> if to the generation following; God ſent his <hi>Prophets,</hi> and found <hi>not faith:</hi> if to the ſucceeding age, God ſent his own <hi>Sonne,</hi> and found not <hi>faith:</hi> And <hi>when the Sonne of man commeth</hi> againe, <hi>ſhall he find faith on the earth?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 18.8.</note> So contrary is it to our corrupt natures, to beleeue any thing, which by diſcourſe of reaſon we cannot comprehend, or wherewith by cuſtome, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we haue not beene invred.</p>
            <p>In this generall defect what ſhall we doe? It is no bad coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to lay before our eies the example of our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> for imitation. A promiſe was made to him, Gen. 15.5. <hi>thy ſeed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1744:75"/> ſhall be in number as the ſtarres in heauen.</hi> Faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> conſidered not his <hi>owne body,</hi> even now <hi>dead,</hi> being almoſt an hundred yeares old; neither the <hi>deadneſſe</hi> of <hi>Sarahs wombe,</hi> but <hi>beleeued</hi> the promiſe of God.

            </p>
            <p>See we not in this patterne, how we ought to be affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>promiſes of God?</hi> we muſt <hi>beleeue them,</hi> even <hi>againſt hope,</hi> being fully aſſured, that he who hath <hi>promiſed,</hi> is <hi>able</hi> alſo <hi>to performe.</hi> What if <hi>tentations</hi> aſſayle vs?

               <hi>Dwell in this land, and I will be with thee, and bleſſe thee,</hi> ſaith the LORD vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 26.3. Without doubt it is a great bleſſing of God vpon his children, when they abide <hi>where God appointeth them.</hi> If wee carue vnto our ſelues, it ſhall be vnto vs according to our boldneſſe.

            <p>I deny not, but that the conſciences of the godly can hardly be quieted, ſo long as they feele Gods wrath againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For thus we read in the prayer of the Church; LORD, <hi>how long? wilt thou be angry for ever? ſhall thy ielouſie burne like fire?</hi> Pſal. 79.5. LORD, <hi>how long? How long</hi> wilt thou withhold thine helpe and aid from vs, and let the wicked inſult over vs, as they doe? <hi>Wilt thou be angry for ever?</hi> Wilt thou never put an end to our miſeries, thoſe teſtimonies of thy heavy wrath, and continuall anger againſt vs? <hi>Shall thy ielouſie,</hi> over thine owne glory, and vs alſo, (even for our good could wee ſee it) ſhall it <hi>burne like fire?</hi> ſhall it conſume vs vtterly, as the fire doth every thing that is before it? I deny not, I ſay, but that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences of the Godly, ſometimes diſquieted with the feeling they haue of Gods wrath, may enforce them to breake out into theſe, or the like ſpeeches: but aſſured I am, they ſhould in all hope and patience wait vpon the LORD, who by his <hi>Prophet,</hi> Pſ. 37.10. hath thus ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to alay this their impatiencie: <hi>Yet a little while, and the wicked ſhall not appeare: looke after his place, and hee ſhall not be found.

            <p n="1">1 <hi>God oftentimes withdraweth himſelfe, &amp; his gracious help from his children, to make them the more earneſt in ſeeking to him.</hi>

            <p>Touching the firſt; namely, that <hi>God withdraweth himſelfe, &amp; his gracious helpe from his children, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the more earneſt in ſeeking to him,</hi> we haue the confeſſion of Chriſts own <hi>ſpouſe;</hi> who opening the dore of her hart to her welbeloved, that was now paſt and gone, and making diligent ſearch to finde him, <hi>her ſoule ſo loved him,</hi> ſpeaketh thus, Cant. 3.1. <hi>I ſought him, but I found him not:</hi> and againe, Cant. 3.2. <hi>I ſought him, but I founde him not:</hi> and ſo likewiſe, Cant. 5.6. <hi>I ſought him, but I coulde not finde him; I called him, but he anſwered me not.</hi> Wee haue alſo <hi>Davids</hi> proteſtation: <hi>In waiting haue I waited for the</hi> LORD, I haue <hi>waited pacitntly for him,</hi> Pſal. 40.1.

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond was this; <hi>God oftentimes deferreth his helpe till

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, learne we of the <hi>spouſe,</hi> to <hi>ſeeke</hi> and never <hi>leaue ſeeking,</hi> til we finde our <hi>beſt-beloved;</hi> learne we of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>waite,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>leaue waiting,</hi> till <hi>our God</hi> encline to vs, and heare our crie, learne we of the <hi>reſt of Gods children</hi> to <hi>requeſt,</hi> &amp; never <hi>leaue requeſting</hi> with vnexpreſſeable ſighes, till <hi>God</hi> come with his right hand ſtretched-out <hi>to lift vs vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why ſhould we at the firſt looke to haue our deſires? <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was <hi>old</hi> before he had any children, and ſo was <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and yet in the end the Lord <hi>promiſed,</hi> and alſo <hi>performed.</hi> It is a certainety, when we haue <hi>leſt hope</hi> for obtaining our deſires, we may <hi>ſooneſt</hi> receiue them. God vſeth not at the firſt to grant our requeſts, but differreth them for the triall of our <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> that like as the <hi>wheat corne</hi> groweth not til it be <hi>dead;</hi> ſo <hi>his workes</hi> may not anſwere our <hi>expectation,</hi> till they ſeeme to vs <hi>vnpoſſible.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Iudeth,</hi> chap. 8.14. ſpake vnto the governour of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> ſo let me to you, my brethren, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke not the Lord our God to anger; the words are in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the 14. verſe; My brethren, <hi>provoke not the Lord our God to anger,</hi> it followeth; <hi>for if he will not helpe vs, within theſe fiue daies, he hath power to defend vs when he will, even every day, or to deſtroy vs before our enimies. Do not</hi> you therefore <hi>bind the counſels of</hi> the Lord <hi>our God,</hi> bind not the counſels of the Lord our God. <hi>For God is not as man, that he may threatned, neither as the ſonne of man to be brought to iudgement; therfore let vs waite for ſalvation of him, and call vpon him to helpe vs, &amp; he wil heare our voice, if it pleaſe him;</hi> he wil heare our voice, if it pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>Therfore be of good comfort, you that now <hi>ſorrow,</hi> for you
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1744:78"/> ſhalbe <hi>comforted;</hi> you that now be <hi>hungry,</hi> for you ſhal be <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;</hi> you that now <hi>weep,</hi> for you ſhal <hi>laugh.</hi> The Lord wil ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come, <hi>beare but a little,</hi> and in his time all ſhall be well with you, <hi>all teares ſhall be wiped from your eies,</hi> and be you aſſured, that whatſoever he hath <hi>promiſed</hi> to you, (ſo <hi>true</hi> is he, ſo <hi>good</hi> is he, ſo <hi>himſelfe</hi> is he, ſo <hi>conſtant,</hi> ſo <hi>vnmoueable</hi> is he) it ſhal be <hi>fulfilled;</hi> the LORD will riſe earely to do it: he will ſet <hi>wheeles</hi> as it were, to his <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> that he may <hi>ſpeedily</hi> bring it to paſſe. And hath he <hi>promiſed</hi> in his good time <hi>to lift you vp?</hi> So will he <hi>lift you vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a word or two of the thing he <hi>promiſed</hi> vnto you: it is your <hi>exaltation,</hi> your <hi>lifting vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where we muſt be warned, not to dreame of any <hi>temporary</hi> exaltation, of any <hi>worldly</hi> lifting vp, like the Iewes who drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the reſtitution of <hi>Davids kingdome,</hi> Mark. 11.10. or like the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who looked that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſhortly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the kingdome to Iſrael,</hi> Act. 1.6. <hi>Preferments</hi> ſhould not be aimed at: <hi>ambition</hi> ſhould be put apart from vs, for our <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation</hi> is ſpirituall, we ſhall <hi>be lifted vp,</hi> but in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but it is God, that advanceth the heads of the mighty over their brethren: by him <hi>kings reigne:</hi> and true it is, <hi>preferment</hi> is neither from the<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 75.6.</note> 
               <hi>Eaſt,</hi> nor from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>South; God is iudge,</hi> he maketh <hi>low,</hi> and he maketh <hi>hie;</hi> he is the beſtower of all <hi>temporall bleſſings.</hi> Yet withall I know that ſuch his bleſſings are beſtowed in <hi>common,</hi> as well on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as the godly: the <hi>Sunne</hi> ſhineth as well on the evil, as on the good: the <hi>raine</hi> falleth as wel on the vniuſt, as the iuſt. God bindeth not himſelfe, either to <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> but ſtoreth vp his <hi>bleſſings</hi> for both: <hi>health, wealth, honour,</hi> and <hi>whatſoever elſe,</hi> this world may affoord, he ſtoreth vp for <hi>both,</hi> iuſt and vniuſt, good and evill, according as himſelfe ſhal diſpoſe to <hi>both.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is he will diſpoſe to both ſorts; but to whom of both ſorts he will diſpoſe, it is not <hi>in man,</hi> nor in any ſonne of man, to diſcerne.</p>
            <p>Set we then our hearts at reſt, for any aſſurance wee haue of theſe <hi>temporall bleſſings:</hi> without doubt our <hi>exaltation</hi> is <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1744:79"/> and ſo ſhall we be <hi>lifted vp.</hi> The holy are vouchſafed to enter into the kingdome of God, but wee know, this entrance muſt be <hi>through many afflictions,</hi> Act. 14.22. Through <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>tribulations,</hi> 2. Theſſ. 1.4. <hi>All that will liue Godly in Christ Ieſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.12.</p>
            <p>Giue care yee <hi>faint spirits,</hi> be ſtrengthened yee <hi>weak hands,</hi> yee <hi>feeble knees</hi> receiue comfort. Is it true indeed, that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be known by the badge of <hi>afflictions,</hi> of <hi>tribulations,</hi> of <hi>perſecutions?</hi> Yet be yee not diſmaide. Be the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you beare, never ſo vnwildy, be it never ſo heavy; there is one in Heaven (&amp; he can come a pace, for he <hi>flieth vpon the wings of the winde</hi>) who is able to maſter it, &amp; to lighten it. And therefore though we walke <hi>in the very ſhadow of death,</hi> we muſt not take diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort at it.</p>
            <p>The Lord ſitteth aboue the water flouds, hee commandeth the Heaven, the Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is. Never will he <hi>forſake</hi> his children, neither in <hi>health</hi> nor <hi>ſickneſſe, light</hi> nor <hi>darknes, in the land of the living,</hi> nor <hi>in the land of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But be it, we are not ſet free from our miſeries; be it, I ſaie, that God ſuffereth vs, as he ſuffered <hi>Stephen</hi> to be ſtoned; or as hee ſuffered <hi>many his bleſſed Martyrs,</hi> to bee ſtretched on the racke, to be burnt with fire, or more grievouſly to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, yet muſt we be full of comfort: for God hath, doth, &amp; yet <hi>hereafter will deliver his children,</hi> and yet hereafter will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver vs, not only from the <hi>death of our bodies,</hi> when <hi>wormes,</hi> &amp; <hi>rottenneſſe</hi> ſhall haue made their laſt <hi>prey</hi> vpon vs, but from the <hi>death of our mindes</hi> too, from that <hi>death,</hi> I ſay, whereby the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is buried vnder <hi>ſorrowes,</hi> and findeth no creature in <hi>Heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> to giue it comfort.</p>
            <p>Content we then our ſelues for any aſſurance he haue of any <hi>temporall exaltation,</hi> it is manifeſt <hi>our exaltation</hi> is <hi>spirituall,</hi> &amp; ſo ſhall we <hi>be lifted vp.</hi> So ſhall <hi>we be lifted vp,</hi> from mortalitie, to immortalitie; from this vale of miſerie, to the citie of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is aboue; from a momentary life, to life eternall. Which eternall life though we cannot fully poſſeſſe as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1744:79"/> long as <hi>this fleſh</hi> encombreth vs, yet in <hi>this fleſh</hi> alſo in part we doe enioy it.

And this is life eternall, ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, Ioh. 17.3.</p>
            <p>Hitherto belongeth that which is written, 1. Cor. 13.9. <hi>wee knowe in part,</hi> and <hi>we prophecie in part.</hi> And Coloſ. 1.13.
